This is a **command-line interface** python application that mimics a basic student management system. 

## Features
- Four available functions.
- Add a student - allows user to record student details.
- Print all records - allows user to print all existing student records to console. 
- Delete records - deletes the text file used to store records. 
- Quit - exits the program.

## Installation
This application is currently only available as a .py file that must be downloaded and ran on a system with python installed. After downloading the file, open a terminal and run the following command: 
> python studentdb.py

## Usage
After running the program, users will be welcomed and prompted to select one of the four options.

If the user selects option 1, they will be prompted to enter student ID, first name and last name. After entering these details, the record will be written to a file named students.txt.
